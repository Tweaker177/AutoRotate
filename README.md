# AutoRotate
Project files for AutoRotate tweak hosted by BigBoss. (Most current version is in YouRepo)
A simple tweak originally made for iOS 10 to rotate the homescreen and lockscreen on devices that don't natively rotate, and for plus devices, it rotates apps and the App Switcher nicely. Additional features have been added as well with labels and the dock. Configure options from settings. The current tweak is working for iOS 10-16, all devices, with the main homescreen and lockscreen rotation working great.   Assistance with insets for the dock with stacked rotation for iOS 12 was given by @ SbhnKhrmn. 

#MOST CURRENT VERSION: You can get it from https://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com/pack/autorotate (it's free). 
Be on the lookout for an update that fixes Widget rotation on iOS 14-16. Well, it makes them go bye bye in landscape mode and the icons space as if they were never there.  Then upon rotating back they magically reappear.  

Made this tweak open source hoping to get help improving the nuances that still act up on devices that don't support SpringBoard rotation natively.
I added rotation of most apps like iPAD, but for compact devices some apps aren't supported. On iOS 14 it rotates HS widgets, though they rotate a little differently. Always am open for contributors if anyone wants 
to improve it.
