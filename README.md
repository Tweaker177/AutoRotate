# AutoRotate
Project files for AutoRotate tweak hosted by BigBoss.

Made it open source and am hoping to get help improving iOS 11 version.
This tweak was originally built and published targeting iOS 10 only, but some of the main features work on iOS 11, so need to update to squish a UI bug on 11 (stacked rotation's dock icons merge on top of each other, and are slightly above dock.)


UPDATE: I have since added rotatiom of all apps like iPAD is, but need to add AppList simce it crashes a few or just looks weird on a couple. still have kinks to iron out. THE original BigBoss tweak.xm file is still there but put most recent update as AutoRotate.xm and changed makefile to reflect that.  Tweak is still beta in current version. BigBoss version works for simple rotation iOS 11 iPhone+ style for nonsupported devices, and the lockscreen rotation works same as iOS 10. Both versions work from iOS 10.0-11.4
