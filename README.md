# AutoRotate
Project files for AutoRotate tweak hosted by BigBoss.

Made it open source and am hoping to get help improving iOS 11 version.
This tweak was originally built and published targeting iOS 10 only, but some of the main features work on iOS 11, so need to update to squish a UI bug on 11 (stacked rotation's dock icons merge on top of each other, and are slightly above dock.)
Would also like to extend support for iOS 9.
