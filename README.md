# AutoRotate
Project files for AutoRotate tweak hosted by BigBoss.

Made it open source and am hoping to get help improving iOS 11 version.
This tweak was originally built and published targeting iOS 10 only, but some of the main features work on iOS 11, so needed to update to squish a UI bug on 11 (stacked rotation's dock icons merged on top of each other, and were slightly above dock.)


UPDATE: I have since added rotation of most apps like iPAD, but need to add AppList simce it crashes a few apps or just looks weird on some others(splits the screen with half blank). Still have kinks to iron out. THE original BigBoss tweak.xm has been modified to update landscape bug. Assistance with insets for the dock with stacked rotation was given by @ SbhnKhrmn 
Tweak is still beta in current version. BigBoss version works for simple rotation iOS 11 iPhone+ style for nonsupported devices, and the lockscreen rotation works same as iOS 10. Both versions work from iOS 10.0-12.4 all devices including A12.
